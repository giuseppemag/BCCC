    [ ] errors
      [ ] wherever type assertion fails, instead of done
      [ ] check that the number of arguments passed to a lambda is correct
    [ ] data-oriented memory: ints, floats, strings, ..., each an array for faster lookup

[ ] closure of s in Option::merge is ugly and should disappear (usual trick of closure as extra dependency ignored by one of the branches)
[ ] inference is sluggish in VSCode
  [ ] split into precompiled JS libraries with .d.ts files
[ ] less interesting distributive laws
  [ ] a^1 = a (apply, curry)
